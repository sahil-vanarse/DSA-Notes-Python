    "#### For eg our social media apps are basically a graph and google maps uses graph to find the path\n",
    "#### There is no hierarchy in this, any node can be connected to the any node and aslo they cannot be connected, they can be also a single node present in it\n"

    "#### Adjacent Node or Vertex : Suppose we have 3 vertex A, B, C. And we A is connected to B and B is connected to C this is known as adjacent edges but A is not connected to C then this is call as non adjacent edges\n",
    "#### Degree : this represents how many edges are passing through the vertex in our case A has 1 because it passes to the B, B has 2 because it passed through the A and C , C has 1 because C it passes to the B only\n",
    "#### Path : we can say that there is a path because to reach C from A we can go from A -> B -> C\n",
    "#### Connected Graph : if there is path between any two vertices in a graph it is known as Connected Graph\n",
    "#### Connected Component : suppose we have a A -> B -> C as one path in a graph we called it as component and D -> E is another component, in this both of this graphs are not connected to each other, there can be multiple sub-graphs in a single graphs\n",
    "#### Tree : it is parent child structure it is also a graph because each child has adjacent child associated with it. Tree is graph but graph is not a Tree. Tree is connected graph, but there is no cycle."
